# lastlocalcase-sg
A webpage showing the number of days since the last local COVID-19 case in Singapore.

## Why did I make this?
I simply made it because I like streak and there wasn't a easy place I could find that told me how many days we've had in Singapore since our last COVID-19 case.

## How does it work?
Unfortunately MoH doesn't have an API for their daily COVID-19 updates.  I simply scrape the data hourly from this site: https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/past-updates
